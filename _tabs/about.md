description: "Sergio Navarro i Fajardo — CTO & DevOps Architect. Hybrid cloud, Kubernetes, VMware, GitOps."
---

**CTO & DevOps Architect** at **Econocom Cloud**. I design, build, and operate **hybrid/multicloud platforms** that power real businesses—combining **Kubernetes**, **VMware**, **GitOps with Argo CD**, **automation with Ansible/Terraform/Packer**, and end-to-end **observability** (Zabbix, Grafana, Prometheus).

## What I’m working on
- Leading the engineering team that runs and evolves Hybrid Cloud’s platforms.
- Product/platform initiatives:
  - **CloudManager Portal** (microservices on Kubernetes + GitOps with Argo CD).
  - **Distributed monitoring** with **Zabbix & Grafana**.
  - Evolution of **VMware Cloud Director** with **NSX-T** and **NSX Advanced Load Balancer**.
  - **Kubernetes-as-a-Service** via **VMware Container Service Extension (Tanzu)**.
  - **Authoritative DNS** with **Infoblox**.
  - **DRaaS** with **VMware Cloud Director Availability**.

## Previously
Systems/Cloud Architect and Head of Systems across public and private sectors (health, energy, education, public administration). I’ve led projects in virtualization, automation, HA, observability, and Oracle databases; and I’ve consulted on consolidation, corporate backup, and network/security.

## Selected certifications
- **CKA – Certified Kubernetes Administrator**
- **AWS Solutions Architect – Associate** and **AWS Cloud Practitioner**
- **Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE)**
- **VMware VCP-DCV**
- Plus training/certs across Docker, Fortinet, Jira/Atlassian, Nutanix, and more.
